#Description
This program will take test cases from the test file and use division conversion and subtraction conversion. It will also print the table as binary, octal, and hexadecimal conversions.
This will include the original, it shifted to the left by 3 and it being masked with 0xFF

#Build Instructions
gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -Wpednatic -02 main.c convert.c -o a1.exe.\a1.exe

#Test Results
I couldn't get any results because I was struggling getting it the read the file and I keep getting an error.

#Notes
Im not gonna lie this assignment was difficult for me because I am very unfamiliar with C. I had to look at a lot of youtube videos to help me understand some, and im still a little lost on how to get everything to connect.
Im used to Java and python, so this was a different experience. The assignment document was very helpful though in getting me started with the coding and what components needed to be included. The main part I struggled on is the
file reading, I have tried writing it like the example in the assignment document and I don't think that it is correct. Everytime I getting my file print out error, like it doesnt get past that point. Maybe I have to completely map out the way to the file, but
the error keeps popping up. So I dont exactly know if my code works, I think most of the logic (except in the main) of it makes sense though.
